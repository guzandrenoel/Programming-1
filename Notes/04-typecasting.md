# Typecasting

Classify the type of data a variable can hold, determining the range of values and the operations that can be performed on it. 

## Implicit (Automatic) 

The compiler automatically converts a data type to another without the programmer needing to write specific code. 

```c
int x = 5;
float y = x;  // y = 5.0

```

## Explicit (Manual)

The programmer uses specific code (a cast) to manually convert one data type to another. 

```c
float a = 8.9;
int b = (int)a;  // b = 8

```
