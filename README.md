# Programming 1 - C Language

This repository contains my comprehensive notes, code examples, and exercises for Programming 1 using the C language. The content is organized into structured folders for easy navigation and learning.

## üìÅ Repository Structure


## üìö Topics Covered

### Basic Concepts
- **Header Files** - Standard library includes and their purposes
- **Variables & Data Types** - Declaration, initialization, and primitive types
- **Format Specifiers** - Input/output formatting with printf/scanf
- **Typecasting** - Implicit and explicit type conversion
- **Escape Sequences** - Special characters in strings

### Operators
- **Unary Operators** - Increment, decrement, and sizeof
- **Arithmetic Operators** - Basic mathematical operations
- **Relational Operators** - Comparison operations
- **Logical Operators** - Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT)
- **Assignment Operators** - Simple and compound assignment
- **Ternary Operator** - Conditional expressions
- **Bitwise Operators** - Low-level bit manipulation

### Control Structures
- **Boolean Expressions** - Truth values and conditions
- **Decision Making** - if, else if, else, and switch statements
- **Control Structures** - Sequence, conditional, and iteration
- **Loops** - while, for, and do-while loops
- **Loop Control** - break and continue statements

### Data Structures
- **Arrays** - Single and multi-dimensional arrays
- **Strings** - Character arrays and string manipulation
- **String Functions** - Built-in string handling functions

### Functions & Memory
- **Functions** - Declaration, definition, and calling
- **Pointers & Addresses** - Memory addresses and pointer variables
- **Parameter Passing** - Pass by value vs pass by reference

## üöÄ How to Use This Repository

1. **Study Notes**: Start with the `Notes/` folder for theoretical understanding
2. **Review Examples**: Check `Examples/` for practical code implementations
3. **Practice**: Attempt exercises in `Exercises/` to reinforce learning
4. **Compile & Run**: Use a C compiler (GCC recommended) to test code examples

## üíª Compilation Instructions

```bash
# Compile a C program
gcc program.c -o program

# Run the compiled program
./program
