- **Typecasting** - Implicit and explicit type conversion
- **Escape Sequences** - Special characters in strings

### Operators (06-12)
- **Unary Operators** - Increment, decrement, and sizeof
- **Arithmetic Operators** - Basic mathematical operations
- **Relational Operators** - Comparison operations
- **Logical Operators** - Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT)
- **Assignment Operators** - Simple and compound assignment
- **Ternary Operator** - Conditional expressions
- **Bitwise Operators** - Low-level bit manipulation

### Control Structures (13-17)
- **Boolean Expressions** - Truth values and conditions
- **Decision Making** - if, else if, else, and switch statements
- **Control Structures** - Sequence, conditional, and iteration
- **Loops** - while, for, and do-while loops
- **Flow Control** - break, continue, and return statements

### Data Structures (18-20)
- **Arrays** - Single and multi-dimensional arrays
- **Strings** - Character arrays and string manipulation
- **String Functions** - Built-in string handling functions

### Functions & Memory (21-23)
- **Pointers & Addresses** - Memory addresses and pointer variables
- **Functions** - Declaration, definition, and calling
- **Parameters & Arguments** - Pass by value vs pass by reference
